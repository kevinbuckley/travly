    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <p><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong><br>
    Your trip data is stored on your device. If you share a trip with collaborators, that specific trip is also visible to the people you invite.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I use TripWit offline?</strong><br>
    Yes! Trip planning, adding stops, and viewing your itinerary all work offline. Weather forecasts, travel time estimates, and collaboration sync require an internet connection.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I collaborate on a trip?</strong><br>
    Open a trip, tap the share icon, and choose "Collaborate." Send the invite via Messages. Your collaborator taps the link, and the trip appears in their app. Everyone can add stops, check off lists, and leave comments in real time.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I share a trip without collaboration?</strong><br>
    You can also share a read-only copy: tap the share icon and choose "Share as PDF" for a formatted itinerary, or "Send a Copy" to export a .tripwit file that others can import into their own app.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I stop sharing a trip?</strong><br>
    Yes. Tap the share icon, choose "Manage Sharing," and remove participants or stop sharing entirely. Collaborators will lose access immediately.</p>

    <p><strong>What are the AI features?</strong><br>
    On supported devices, TripWit can suggest stops, explore nearby places, and help plan your day using Apple's on-device intelligence. All processing happens privately on your device.</p>

    <p><strong>How does photo matching work?</strong><br>
    TripWit compares the GPS coordinates and timestamps of your photos against your trip stops. Matching happens entirely on your device — no photos are uploaded anywhere.</p>
